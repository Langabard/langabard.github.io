# Wrath of Northman

"The peoples of the north," says Helmold Nigel, 
a poet of the ninth century and  of the Frankish king Louis 
the Pious, "were formerly and still are called Danes or Danes. They are also called
Northmen in the Frankish language. They are lively, agile and brave to excess, their fame has penetrated 
into the most distant countries. Living near the sea, they seek their
food in fragile ships; their tall stature, beauty of face and nobility of 
movement forced the conclusion that the Frankish nation descends from them." 



But 
the Franks descended as much from the Northmen as the Northmen descended from the 
Franks. Belonging to the same family, these peoples must have had a resemblance, having come from the same country, but at 
different times, they settled - some to the north, 
others to the south of Germany, and when they met on 
the fields of Gaul, the desire to resemble their victors 
reminded the Franks of their kindred origin with them.

Odin, having given laws to the Baltic peoples, transmitted to them a religion 
entirely in keeping with the needs satisfied by war alone. The Lawgiver of the 
North became its chief 305 deity; he was adored as the father of murders, the 
destroyer of nations, the incendiary. He would appoint in advance 
the warriors who were to perish in battle, and for their souls the maidens,
his messengers, would appear on the battlefield. 

He prepared for the brave 
the rewards of Valhalla (Volhall. - I. Ts.), where the Valkyrie maidens poured 
waves of beer into the skulls of their slain enemies. Cowards were assigned an 
abode in Nastrud (the kingdom of death), where Gela received them in the palace of 
Longing, at the table of Hunger and in the bed of Exhaustion. Twelve gods and as 
many goddesses made up the court of Odin. 

Among these deities the most important
were Freya or Frigga, the goddess of love; Loki or the evil principle; Thor, the 
god of thunder, and Niord, who reigned over the sea and presided over storms. These
deities loved human sacrifices and every nine years there was a solemn assembly at 
Leir, on the island of Zealand, where they brought to the gods a 
double hecatomb of men and horses.

This warlike religion inspired the inhabitants of the North 
with a contempt for life which made them rush blindly into 
the most obvious destruction and seek death as the end of their
labors and the beginning of life beyond the grave. The comrades 
of whom Tacitus speaks, and who devoted themselves to the warlike 
chiefs of Germany, were known in the North under the name of campers 
(koemper) or fighters. 
The ties which bound them to their lords 
were broken only by death. This type of barbarian chivalry also 
had its rules: a camper was forbidden to kidnap women and children, 
to seek shelter from the weather, and to dress his wounds before the 
battle was over. 
When the warlike ardor of these fighters went beyond 
the borders, they joined the ranks of the bersekers (berseker) or 
furious fighters. The courage of these warriors was exposed to the 
blows of enemies and the fury of storms; piracy was a necessity for 
them. The Danes and Scandinavians were subject to high chiefs, called 
over-kongar, and tributary chiefs or vassals, unter-kongar, who were 
for the most part descended from Odin. 
Their succession, as in Germany, 
depended partly on election, partly on right of descent. Of the former 
there were four in Denmark, that is, two in Jutland, one in Leir, and one
in Scania. In Norway there were up to eighteen, and in Sweden less. After 
the lower chiefs came the jarls or earls, who had under them vassals called
(in German herren, barons),
and led to war freemen, known as bends.
